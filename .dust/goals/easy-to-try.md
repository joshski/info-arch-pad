# Easy to try

A new user should understand what info-arch-pad does and try it within minutes. This is especially important for UX/IA professionals who may not be developers.

## Sub-Goals

(none)

## Why this matters

The tool is only useful if people can actually get started with it. UX/IA professionals may not be comfortable with CLI tools or npm installs. Lowering the barrier to entry is essential for adoption beyond the developer audience, and ecosystem pieces like a web playground or better examples directly serve this goal.

## What this means in practice

- A browser-based playground where users can try the DSL without installing anything
- Clear examples that demonstrate common IA patterns
- Documentation written for the target audience, not just developers
- The DSL syntax should be approachable and self-explanatory

## How to evaluate

Work supports this goal if it reduces the number of steps, prerequisites, or domain knowledge required for a new user to produce their first diagram.
