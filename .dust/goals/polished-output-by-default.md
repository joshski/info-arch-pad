# Polished output by default

Diagrams should look professional out of the box. They should be good enough to drop into a presentation, client deliverable, or documentation site without post-processing.

## Why this matters

UX and IA professionals need outputs they can share directly with stakeholders. If the default output looks rough or developer-oriented, it creates friction: users either spend time tweaking the result externally or choose a different tool. Visual polish signals quality and builds trust in the tool.

## What this means in practice

- Default colors, typography, and spacing should produce clean, appealing diagrams
- Theming support so users can match their organization's visual style
- Edges and layout should be clear and readable, even in complex diagrams
- The output should work well at different sizes and in different contexts (slides, docs, web)

## How to evaluate

Work supports this goal if it improves the visual quality of the default output or gives users control over visual presentation without requiring external tools.
