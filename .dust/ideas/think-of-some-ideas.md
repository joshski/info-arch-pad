# Think of some ideas

Remaining ideas not yet captured as tasks.

## Ideas

### Interactive HTML output
Instead of static SVG, generate an HTML page that embeds the SVG with pan/zoom and click-to-expand sections. Large site maps become hard to read as static images; interactivity would make the tool more practical for real IA work.

### Reverse engineering from a live site
A companion tool that crawls a website and generates a `.ia` file from its actual page structure. This would let people visualize existing site architectures without manually writing the DSL.
