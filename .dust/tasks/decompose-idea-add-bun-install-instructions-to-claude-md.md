# Decompose Idea: Add bun install instructions to CLAUDE.md

Create one or more well-defined tasks from this idea. Prefer smaller, narrowly scoped tasks -- split the idea into multiple tasks if it covers more than one logical change. Review `.dust/goals/` to link relevant goals and `.dust/facts/` for design decisions that should inform the task. See [Add bun install instructions to CLAUDE.md](../ideas/add-bun-install-instructions-to-claude-md.md).

## Resolved Questions

### Should the instruction be conditional or unconditional?

**Decision:** Unconditional — always run `bun install`

### Should AGENTS.md be updated alongside CLAUDE.md?

**Decision:** Update both files

### Where in CLAUDE.md should the instruction go?

**Decision:** Before the `bunx dust agent` instruction
