# Decompose Idea: Think of some goals

Create one or more well-defined tasks from this idea. Prefer smaller, narrowly scoped tasks -- split the idea into multiple tasks if it covers more than one logical change. Review `.dust/goals/` to link relevant goals and `.dust/facts/` for design decisions that should inform the task. See [Think of some goals](../ideas/think-of-some-goals.md).

## Resolved Questions

### Which audience should goals prioritize?

**Decision:** UX/IA professionals designing new structures

### How many goals should the project carry at once?

**Decision:** Focus on one or two

### Should goals be scoped to the CLI tool, or include ecosystem?

**Decision:** Include ecosystem
