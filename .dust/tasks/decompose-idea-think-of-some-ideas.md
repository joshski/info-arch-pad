# Decompose Idea: Think of some ideas

Create one or more well-defined tasks from this idea. Prefer smaller, narrowly scoped tasks -- split the idea into multiple tasks if it covers more than one logical change. Review `.dust/goals/` to link relevant goals and `.dust/facts/` for design decisions that should inform the task. See [Think of some ideas](../ideas/think-of-some-ideas.md).
